# Introduction

Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness that can lead to hospitalization or even death due to associated complications. High-risk groups include individuals aged 65 and above, those with underlying health conditions, and young children. Annual vaccination against seasonal flu is recommended by health authorities worldwide, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which advises vaccination for everyone aged six months and older.

The H1N1 influenza pandemic emerged in 2009, originating from the influenza A virus in the United States.

Problem Statement As the global effort to vaccinate against COVID-19 continues, understanding people's attitudes, behaviors, and backgrounds regarding seasonal flu vaccination is crucial. Vaccine hesitancy, driven by vaccine safety and efficacy concerns, poses a significant challenge to public health efforts. 
Individualsâ€™ vaccination decisions are influenced by personal beliefs, social contexts, and evolving perceptions overtime.

## Main Objective 

This project aims to develop a predictive model for seasonal flu vaccine uptake based on demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal factors.

### Specific Objectives

Impact of Education Level: Investigate whether education level influences the likelihood of receiving the seasonal flu vaccine.

Effect of Age and Employment: Examine how age and employment status affect the likelihood of seasonal flu vaccine uptake.

Role of Concern and Knowledge about H1N1: Assess the relationship between levels of concern and knowledge about the H1N1 flu and the likelihood of receiving the seasonal flu vaccine.


# Data Exploration

The datasets used for this project were downloaded from Driven Data. The original data source is the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS). 
Two data sets are merged training_set_features containing information about the respondents, such as knowledge about H1N1, behavioral habits, and demographic details, and training_set_labels provides the target variables for each respondent, indicating whether they received the H1N1 vaccine (h1n1_vaccine) and the seasonal vaccine (seasonal_vaccine). It contains information on the social, economic,  and demographic backgrounds of the respondents as well as their opinions on the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. The datasets have been divided into the training set features and the training set labels. The training data has 26707 rows and 36 columns.


# Conclusion and Recommendations

Education Level: Vaccination rates are higher among those with higher education. Efforts should be made to target awareness campaigns to those with lower educational levels, possibly using easily accessible and understandable formats.

Income and Poverty: There's a need for targeted campaigns in areas with higher poverty rates, possibly combined with subsidies or free vaccination programs to encourage higher vaccination rates among this demographic.

Targeted Interventions: Race: There's a notable disparity in vaccination rates among racial groups. Targeted interventions and campaigns should be developed to address the specific concerns and barriers faced by the racial groups with lower vaccination rates. Sex: While the difference is slight, efforts can be made to ensure that both males and females have equal access to information and vaccination opportunities
